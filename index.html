                        Hi! I’m Robin (They/Them) a tech educator and career mentor with over 15 years of experience as a software developer across the industry.
                        I believe learning tech skills should be more accessible, and I want to use my experience to provide an alternative path for people
                        looking to shift their careers. Through project oriented courses, personalized lessons, and guided self-learning, you'll build more than just coding skills.

                        Learning tech skills shouldn’t be as daunting or difficult as it can be, and there’s all kinds of reasons why tech is dominated by certain
                        demographics. I don’t think it has to be that way. I think that a lot of the barriers are unnecessary, you don’t need to be super smart to
                        write code, and these skills are useful even if you’re not trying to work in tech. But, I also think it would be great to bring more diversity
                        into the industry from the bottom up by helping people break into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you ask just about anyone who codes for a living they’ll tell you a solid project portfolio is often a better metric than a certification
                        or degree. One-on-one teaching isn't only cheaper, I also believe it's a more accessible way to learn. Whether you’re exploring a career transition,
                        looking to pick up new skills, or just want to improve interviewing, contact me for a free consultation to see if I can help you out.

                                If you ask most devs, they'll say that a strong set of public projects is a better marker for skills than a degree or certification.
                                With project oriented courses, you'll learn through practical experience and end with your own personal to site to show off
                                what you've built.

                                two of the most popular languages, and knowing both will give you the flexibility to find more opportunities

                                Frankly, the tech hiring process can really suck. Navigating it is a skillset separate from any coding experience that
                                requires its own practice. Learn techniques for time-pressured coding challenges, how to talk the talk in interviews,
                                and feel more confident applying to jobs.

                                There's a lot more to software development than learning languages and building apps. Getting comfortable with tools devs
                                use like the command line console and code editors will make writing code easier and more fun, while knowing how networking
                                and operating systems work will help you understand software at a deeper level.

                                Getting stuck on a problem and not knowing the answer happens all the time in software development. It's an open secret that
                                knowing how to Google stuff and find the information you need is part of the job. With courses that include self-learning,
                                you'll practice this kind of searching while building problem solving skills.

                                There's a lot to learn with software development, so courses are broken down into smaller, focused blocks.
                                Shorter blocks help make progress feel faster with more consistent positive feedback. Since each block
                                includes a project component, you'll also gain practical experience building as you go.

                            <p style="text-align: left;">
                                Though the blocks build on each other, they don't have to be done in the same order or can be skipped
                                altogether. If there's a only few things you're interested in that's totally cool - you can focus on
                                just what you want.
